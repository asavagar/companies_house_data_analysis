# companies_house_data_analysis
I report Companies House data on "basic company data".

The full data file in `.csv` format can be found here: http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html

The file is ~2GB so `00-read.R` reads in necessary variables and saves as a smaller `.csv`.

This data reports basic company data of live companies on the register.
